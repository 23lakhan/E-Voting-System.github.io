<h3><b>Q.Why should we give vote?</b></h3><br>
The citizens the power to elect leaders of their choice and hold the elected leaders accountable
<ul>
<i>
<li>The power to vote for your country is an important part of a democratic country like India. While many in our country are eligible to cast vote, few are enthusiastic about it. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the voter turnout was 67.11% which is the highest turnout in the history of India. With every election, there has been a positive increase in voter turnout. Such an increase in voting is a positive welcome, as each and every vote counts for a better future of our country.</li>
<br>
<li> However, there has always been a disconnect between the voters and the election process. It has been observed that the many voters do not take the election process seriously and do not understand the gravity of the power to vote and the responsibility that comes along with it. This is especially true in the case of the urban population where the voting day is usually considered as just another holiday since it is not made compulsory or mandatory for every citizen to vote.
